# AutoTester
- This tool was originally created by myself for a specific workspace (Using private DLLs) and not expected to be functional. although with minor changes it probably can be used in other workspaces as well. 
- This tool allows executing scripts automatically by reading test scenarios from an **excel file** (including scenario inputs, scenario expected result, image comparing, screenshot/video capture, svn integration and more)
